1. To compile:

 a) install gmp library
 b) download and install yices 1.0
 c) gcc -o c2bp -I $YICES/include -L $YICES/lib c2bp.c -lyices -lgmp

2. To run:

c2bp <code> <predicates>

3. For code:

   -- beginit: denotes the start of the initialization section
   -- endinit: denotes the end of the initialization section

   -- all statements should be on separate lines, e.g.:
      x = 1
      2 = 5
      x = 5;
   -- commas are optional (it should work with them or without them).
   -- labels as numbers are allowed, e.g.:
   
      5: z = 5;

   -- there can be multiple variables referenced in the RHS, e.g: x = y + z is allowed.
   -- if statements are:

		if (...) 
			{...} 
		else 
			{...} 
		endif

   -- (...) is just a predicate:  if we want: x > 0 and y < 5, we write:

     ( (x > 0) & (y < 5) )

    that is, use the proper nestedness of brackets. This is NOT allowed:

      (x > 0 & y < 5)

   -- operators: AND is '&' and OR is '|', equality is '=', disequalities are allowed: '<=', '>=', '<', '>'.

   -- the if statement needs to be layed out as shown above (i.e. on separate lines).
   -- the '{' and '}' brackets are ignored.
   -- nested ifs are NOT allowed.

   -- 'initial:', see example, denotes the initialization section.
   -- 'process <num>:', denotes the process number, see example

4. For predicate file:
   -- each predicate on a separate line, surrounded by braces, e.g. (x > 0) is ok, but x > 0 is not.

5. The files 'code' and 'pred' contain examples.
